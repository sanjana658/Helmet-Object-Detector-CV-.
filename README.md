# Helmet-Object-Detector-CV-.
Helmet Detection using YOLOv8 – A beginner-friendly computer vision project that detects motorcycle helmets in images and videos using a custom-trained YOLOv8 model. Built with Python and Ultralytics, covering dataset preparation, training, and real-time inference.

This project is a beginner-to-intermediate Computer Vision Object Detection application built using YOLOv8 (You Only Look Once) and Python. The goal of the project is to automatically detect whether a person is wearing a helmet in images and videos by drawing bounding boxes around detected helmets.

The project starts from scratch and covers the complete object detection pipeline, including dataset preparation, environment setup, model training, inference, and result evaluation. A custom helmet detection dataset was used, and the model was trained locally on a Mac CPU.
